# Customer Health Risk Definition

**Governed metric key:** `active_customers`
**Owner team:** customer_success
**Notion:** `notion://notion_page_customer_health_playbook#risk-definition`
**Sources:** `mart_customer_health`, `int_customer_health_signals`

## Risk Levels

`low`, `medium`, `high` — derived from two signal types:

1. **Support ticket signals** (`stg_support_tickets`): open or pending tickets with severity `high` or `critical` increase risk.
2. **Procurement activity signals** (`stg_purchase_requests`, `stg_purchase_orders`): recent qualifying procurement actions reduce risk.

## Intermediate Model

`int_customer_health_signals` — combines open critical ticket count and recent procurement action count per account.

## Mart

`mart_customer_health` — account-grain risk mart as of **2026-03-31**.

- `account_id`: dbt not_null, unique
- `risk_level`: dbt accepted_values [low, medium, high]

## Support Ticket Severities

`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`

## Account Ownership Context

`stg_account_owners` provides effective-dated ownership (owner_team: sales_ops, customer_success, finance) for escalation routing.
